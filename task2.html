               <br>HTML: HTML stands for HyperText Markup 
                Language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. 
                Hypertext defines the link between the web pages
                and markup language defines the text
                document within the tag that define the structure
                of web pages.</br>
                The < div > tag is used as a container for
                HTML elements - which is then styled with 
                CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.    
            Media Query is a CSS technique that is
                used to produce a responsive design. 
                Essentially, it includes conditions.</br>
            <br>Tasks so far: 1. Basic website on ipl, 2.Responsive website using @media queries and div tags.</p>

            <br>Machine Learning is the field of study that
            gives computers the capability to learn without
            being explicitly programmed. ML is one of the 
            most exciting technologies that one would have
            ever come across. 
            Machine learning is actively being used today,
            perhaps in many more places than one would expect.
            Machine Learning is an essential skill for any
            aspiring data analyst and data scientist, and
            also for those who wish to transform a 
            massive amount of raw data into trends and
            predictions.</br>
       <br> Tasks so far: Learning Python, Numpy and pandas 
       modules, Machine learning from scratch.</br> </p>
